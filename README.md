## timer

A simple 60 second timer implementation in _NodeJS_ (Express) and _socket.io_. Can be used as a pomodoro timer in scrum meetings, for example.
The timer uses _socket.io_ to broadcast time, so (ideally) all clients see exactly the same time.

This software was built in a mob programming session at Ambientia's hack-a-night event. Participants took turns in 5 minute intervals.

## Running it

Clone the repository and run ```npm update``` inside the repository. Run ```npm run-script start``` to start the application.
